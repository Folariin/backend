# Grocery Household App — Backend

A RESTful backend API for a shared grocery list application.  
Users can create households, collaborate on grocery lists, invite others to join, and track purchased items.

Built with **Spring Boot**, **JWT authentication**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Features

### Authentication & Security
- User signup and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Stateless backend (no server-side sessions)
- Protected endpoints using Spring Security

---

### Households
- Create households
- View households a user belongs to
- Role-based membership:
    - `OWNER`
    - `MEMBER`
- Only owners can invite new members

---

### Grocery Lists
- Create multiple grocery lists per household
- View all lists within a household
- Lists are shared among all household members

---

### List Items
- Add items to a grocery list
- Specify quantity, unit, and optional notes
- Mark items as purchased or unpurchased
- Track:
    - who purchased an item
    - when it was purchased
- Soft-delete items using status flags

---

### Invitations
- Household owners can invite users by email
- Invitations are stored server-side with secure tokens
- Invited users can:
    - view pending invitations
    - accept invitations to join households
- Invitation tokens are single-use and validated on acceptance

> Email delivery is **not implemented**.  
> Invited users see invitations after signing up and logging in with the invited email.
